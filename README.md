# parachute, the new tellor deity

The Parachute is the new tellor deity, replacing the Tellor team's mutlis account. The motivation behind the Parachute contract is to re-DAO-ify Tellor. The Parachute only functions to restore the Tellor team deity under the following limited, worst-case circumstances:

* Underflow attack (unlimited minting)
* Broken mining (now mining events for a pre-set amount of time)
* Tellor updates to something non-functional (the zero address)

Also includes custom migration logic and the ability to send deity to zero address, rendering the Parachute useless.
